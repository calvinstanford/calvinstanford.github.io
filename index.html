<p> Personal Statement</p>
<p>I am a recent graduate, graduating with a Bachelor of Computer and Information Science, majoring in Software Development, where I studied at Auckland University of Technology.
</br>I graduated in November and am enthused to develop professional knowledge and skills in the industry.
</br>I enjoy working with diverse, multidisciplinary teams of people from different backgrounds.
</br>I thrive in creative environments where we can plan and brainstorm different approaches to creating applications and software. 
</br>During my studies I enjoyed using Java and web development and would like to be able to grow skills that I have already learnt, along with keeping up to date with new technology and methodologies.</p>
